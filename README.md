Demographics: age, gender, education, etc.
Job-related details: department, job role, tenure, overtime, promotions.
Performance indicators: performance ratings, number of projects, satisfaction levels.
Churn target: indicates whether the employee has left the company.

Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand employee demographics and job-related factors.
- Visualize key trends in churn across departments, roles, and satisfaction levels.
- Identify potential factors influencing employee turnover.
- Summarize findings in an actionable way for HR or business decision-making.
- Prepare the dataset for ML: handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features if needed.
- Build classification models to predict employee churn (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Analyze feature importance to determine key drivers of churn.
- Summarize patterns and ML findings in actionable recommendations.
- Suggest HR strategies to reduce turnover based on data-driven insights.
